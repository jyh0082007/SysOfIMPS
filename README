Plan needed to be done 
Due on 20th, January

liwenhaosuper:
1. 
Solve the NAT related problems and make the media chat available for Peers in GPRS-GPRS mode and GRPS-WIFI mode.
Currently,I have found that the failure of connection between P2P is the NAT problems.
2. 
Implement the event handling for audio and media chat.
